## Important

Notice that this little web app is a 25 hours student project. The main objective of this project : learning php with symfony.
Hence, I do **not** garantee the security of the app.



### Skinator

With skinator, players can add their skin to their collection. 
They can all create sub-collection called wardrobe to show them to the world, this may help people to sell or exchange skins for exemple (exchange system is not implemented in the ap tho). A ranking system might be implements along with its leaderboard. Items of each rarity will value a certain amount of points, your rank will follow your points.


Unique  	 +500 points
Legendary  +100 points 
Epique     +50  points
rare			 +5   points
common     +0   points
